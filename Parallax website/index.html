			Thankyou for showing interest,
			here is a quick story of me and
			this website. My programming
			journey started back in 2021,
			2 year before I started
			studying computer application in DCCL Latur.
			I am currently in my third
			year. I like
			coding all kind of problems
			from the very basic like adding
			numbers to the complex ones like
			competitive programming problems.
			I love making projects, websites and games.
			Infact this website is one of my
			Web Development Projects which
			is built using HTML and CSS.<br>
			<br>Languages known : C Language, react,express,bootstrap Python, JavaScript,
			MySQL.<br> IT Constructs : Data
			Structures and Algorithm, OOP,
			HTML, CSS, and Git & GitHub.
